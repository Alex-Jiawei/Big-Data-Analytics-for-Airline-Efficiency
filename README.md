# Big Data Analytics for Airline Efficiency: A Project on Flight Delay Prediction, Marketing Optimization, and Operational Improvement
#### University of Chicago - ACSP 31013 - Big Data Platforms final project
##### Executive Summary:
The aviation industry faces challenges managing flight delays, incurring substantial costs, and disrupting passenger experiences. FAA/Nextor estimated these annual delay costs to be approximately $28 billion. Utilizing big data tools, a vast flight dataset (over 29 million records) sourced from Kaggle was analyzed, addressing complexities, data quality, and regulatory variations. Insights revealed typical minor delays (12-13 mins) affecting 17-18% of flights, with preprocessing involving string indexing, one-hot encoding, feature creation, scaling, and feature selection within a structured pipeline.

Objectives and Key Outcomes:
Association Mining for Marketing: Identified strong airline-airport associations with ORD and American Airlines.
Graph Theory for Delay Reduction: Incorporated delays in edges as weights in graph theory, pinpointing influential airports for minimizing operational disruptions.
Flight Delay Prediction: Developed predictive models resulting in a model of AUC of 0.602, F1 Score of 0.744, and Accuracy of 0.824.
Predictive Maintenance: Implemented models forecasting maintenance needs for optimal aircraft rotation.

##### Business Objectives: The 4 Goals and Scope of this Project
1. Association Mining for Targeted Marketing: Identify traveler behavior patterns by uncovering correlations between airports and preferred airlines, aiding airline marketing teams in tailoring strategies for route planning and passenger engagement.
2. Graph-Based Analysis for Delay Reduction: Utilize delay-integrated network representation to analyze delay propagation across airports and airlines, helping airline operations teams identify influential nodes and routes to minimize delays and enhance operational efficiency.
3. Flight Delay Prediction for Improved Operations: Develop predictive models to forecast flight delays, empowering airline operations and passenger service teams to proactively manage schedules and provide timely information, improving overall customer experience.
4. Predictive Maintenance for Optimal Aircraft Rotation: Forecast maintenance needs to optimize aircraft rotation schedules, enabling airline maintenance and fleet management teams to ensure safety, reliability, and cost-effectiveness in aircraft management.
